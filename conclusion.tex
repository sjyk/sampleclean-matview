\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a new approach to the staleness problem in materialized views.
We demonstrated how recent results from data cleaning, namely sampling, query correction, and outlier detection, can
allow for accurate query processing on stale views for a fraction of the cost of incremental maintenace.
We evaluated this approach on a single node and in a distributed environment and found that sampling can provide a flexible tradeoff 
between accuracy and performance.
In one of our end-to-end experiments with a 1TB log dataset from Conviva, we found that...\reminder{Find way to summarize these experiments}

Our results are promising and suggest many avenues for future work.
``Serving" machine learning models has been a recent hot topic of database research [?].
We believe there is a strong link between machine learning models and materialized views, and the principles of our approach could be applied
to streaming machine learning applications.
For example, we can sample a data stream and update a model (eg. via Stochastic Gradient Descent).

Another promising direction is to extend this approach to support a more general class of queries.
To support general selection queries, we will have to extend our query correction to predict and attribute value via a regression.
This is an ideal application for non-parametric regression techniques such as Gaussian Process Regression which do
not make strong assumptions about the distribution of the data.
