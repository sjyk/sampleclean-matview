We thank the reviewers for the very helpful feedback on our paper. We have addressed all of the listed concerns and have included references to the revised text in the cover letter. 
To summarize the major revisons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We revise our background section (Section \ref{subsec-inc}) to include a detailed running example which is referenced in Example 1-6 after each major concept.
\item We revised Section 3 to formalize our problem setting, assumptions, terminology, and key prerequiste concepts in our work and included more formal problem statements.
\item Stale Sample View Cleaning (Section 4) includes a longer discussion about the challenges and new ideas (Section 4.1) and clarifies a significant reviewer request about the definition of ``primary keys".
\item Query Result Estimation (Section 5) has been revised to include itemized descriptions of all of the algorithms and is self-contained with respect to our prior work.
\item Experiments (Section 7) has been revised to remove an experiment applying our technique to a data cube and a detailed distributed performance analysis of our approach. As suggested by the reviewers, while illustrating an engineering effort, the experiments do not enhance the theory presented in this paper and the additional space was valuable to have a more detailed discussion about key concepts.
\end{enumerate}
We first will detaile our changes in response to the meta reviewer comments and then address the detailed reviewer comments subsequently.

\noindent\textbf{Meta Reviews}

\emph{The definitions and discussions, which are currently presented in a very hand-waiving manner, need to be replaced with their formal counterparts. The presentation should be revised, also to avoid the continuous references to the tech report for details. Please see the detailed comments E1 of reviewer 1, and C1,C2, C4, C5, and C6 of reviewer 2 for more details.}

We have significantly clarified the presentation of the concepts and the algorithms presented in the paper. Section 3.1 (Notations and Definitions) has been expanded to formally present the core preliminaries of our work: Materialized Views, Staleness, Relational Expressions for Maintenance, and Uniform Sampling. Section 3.2 presents an itemized workflow of SVC and formal descriptions of the problems that SVC solves. In Section 4, we added Definition 1 (provenance), Proposition 1 (how to get provenance with primary keys), and Property 1 (formalization of the correspondence property). We revised Section 5 to have an itemized description of the query processing approaches in this work.  Additionally, the technical report is now only cited in the Experiments section with reference to details in the experimental setup and materialized view choice.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{There are several assumptions and restrictions that are not spelled out clearly in the first part of the paper. It should be clarified how much they limit the applicability of the proposal. The real-world scenarios used is very interesting, but do the techniques apply in other popular applications, where the assumption in sec 4.2 may not hold?}

We have revised the presentation of the work to be more explicit about limitations. We added the following paragraph before the problem statements in Section 3.1:
``In SVC, we explore the problem of approximate aggregate query
processing on stale materialized views using a data cleaning approach.
We assume that these materialized views are periodically
maintained and thus are stale in between maintenance periods. The
focus of this paper is analytic workloads where the typical query on the view is a group by aggregate. SVC provides a framework for increased
query accuracy for a flexible additional maintenance cost that can
scale with system constraints."

We believe this concisely summarizes our problem domain and applicability of our proposal. 
Furthermore, we have clarified that the primary key definition proposed in 4.2 
(Section 4.3 in the revised paper) is not an assumption but a generation procedure. For the relational expressions described in the paper (select, project, join, aggregate, union, difference), if there is a unique primary key for the base relations, we can ensure that any derived relation also has a unique primary key by the rules described in Definition 2. If the base relations do not have primary keys, then we can add an extra column to the relation that assigns each row a unique id. We added Example 2 to describe this process concretely.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{There are recent proposals in data cleaning over materialized views that tackle an orthogonal problem: While the setting is different, work has been done on how to use a different statistical measure (sensitivity analysis) to tackle similar technical problems (sec 5.1.1, sec 6.3). The authors can find related techniques in the recent work on data cleaning over views. It would be useful to have a technical discussion of how the proposed techniques can be applied in this related setting and vice versa (an experimental evaluation is not needed): (1) Wu and Madden. Scorpion: Explaining Away Outliers in Aggregate Queries. PVLDB 2013, (2) Chalamalla et al. Descriptive and prescriptive data cleaning. SIGMOD 2014, (3) Meliou et al. Tracing data errors with view-conditioned causality. SIGMOD 2011}

We have added a paragraph to our related work (Section 8) contrasting these works from ours. While, all three of these works address the issue of lineage in the materialized views they are not directly applicable to our problem. These three works require an explicit specification of the errors on a materialized view, and then trace the errors to the base data. In our work, specifying the errors is equivalent to full incremental maintenance since we do not know which rows are incorrect, missing, and superfluous. From the text:
``For example, Wu and Madden \cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/0002M13} studied explanations for outliers in group-by aggregate queries. The technique used to trace the provenance of an outlier row in a result is very similar to the technique proposed in this work. However, this work addressed a different cleaning problem from \svc. In \svc, we look to find a relational expression that update an erroneous row such that it is correct. In \cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/0002M13}, the authors remove base data such that the row is no longer an outlier. Also, Challamalla et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ChalamallaIOP14} proposed a technique for specifying errors as constraints on a materialized view and proposing changes to the base data such that these constraints can be satisfied.
In our setting, we do not know these constraints a priori and we would have to materialize the entire up-to-date view to be able to specify which rows are erroneous.Finally, the work by Meliou et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/MeliouGNS11} also explores tracing lineage through materialized views. Like \cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/0002M13}, it requires an explicit specification of the errors and also does not suggest a cleaning operation to fix these errors."

\vspace{1em}
\emph{The experiments sections needs to be improved to include comparison with relevant work, more details and explanation. Please look at the detailed comments E2, E4, and E5 of reviewer 1, and B1 and B2 of reviewer 2 for more details. }

We have addressed all of the details from reviewer comments in the reviewer section of the cover letter. To summarize, we cited the algorithm that we used for Incremental View Maintenance which is the change-table (called a delta table in our work) algorithm described in “Incremental maintenance of aggregate and outerjoin expressions” by Gupta and Mumick 2006. We further clarified our contribution for the two compared query processing approaches, SVC+CORR and SVC+AQP. Both techniques use our Stale View Cleaning technique but have a different result estimation procedure. There were also reviewer concerns about selectivity (for which we added a theoretical analysis) and update size (for which we clarified the experiment in which those results can be seen).
In addition, two reviewers suggest removing our detailed evaluation on a distributed platform to save space. We have rearranged our experiments such that we still present accuracy and performance results for the real dataset from Conviva Inc. but do not describe the details of our implementation and deployment on Apache Spark.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{The paper's main motivation is that eager IVM cannot keep up with the rate of incoming updates. However, there have been approaches in the literature (most notable DBToaster) suggesting that this issue can be resolved by accelerating IVM. Do you think that there is still a need of SVC? What is the rate of updates over which a system such as DBToaster cannot keep up with the updates?}

In the paper (Section 2.1), we have added the following clarification and motivation of the work:
``There has been significant research on fast MV maintenance algorithms, most recently DBToaster \cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/KochAKNNLS14}. However, even for these optimized systems, some materialized views are computationally difficult to maintain. In their evaluation of DBToaster, Koch et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/KochAKNNLS14} reported a three order of magnitude variation in maintenance throughput over the 22 TPCH queries defined as MVs. Furthermore, in real deployments, it is common to use the same infrastructure to maintain multiple materialized views (along with other analytics tasks) adding further contention to computational resources and reducing overall maintenance throughput. SVC is complementary to existing maintenance algorithms, whether 1st order like classical change-table IVM or higher order like DBToaster, provided they are specified in standard relational algebra. Through the use of sampling, we provide the user another tool to flexibly manage and schedule maintenance of MVs for aggregate analytics."

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Typos and other minor issues as listed by E6 of reviewer 1 and C7, C8, C9, C10 and C11 of reviewer 2 should be addressed.}
We thank the reviewers for their careful read of the paper, and have addressed these issues.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{Reviewer 1}
\emph{Theorem 2 is based on a very naive assumption. The assumption that nothing else is known about the distribution is false in this setting. Given the data in the materialized view, a pretty good a priori estimation of the distribution of the data can be made. Given this estimation, the estimator (MVUE) that best fits the distribution should be chosen. It is not enough to just separate out some outliers.}

We thank the reviewer for this detailed comment and clarified the concepts presented in Section 5.2.4 as more a discussion about optimality (the conditions under which the presented approach is optimal) rather than an absolute claim of optimality. We further revised that our approach is complementary to the choice of estimator and if the data distribution warrants a different estimator with lower variance SVC+CORR and SVC+AQP inherit that optimality property. From the text:  
``A sampled relation $R$ defines a discrete distribution. It is important to note that this distribution is different from the data generating distribution, since even if $R$ has continuous valued attributes $R$ still defines a discrete distribution. Our population is finite and we take a finite sample thus every sample takes on only a discrete set of values. In the general case, this distribution is only described by the set of all of its values (i.e no smaller parametrized representation). In this setting, the sample mean is an MVUE. In other words, if we make no assumptions about the underlying distribution of values in $R$, SVC+AQP and SVC+CORR are optimal for their respective estimates ($q(S')$ and $c$). Since they estimate different variables, even with optimality SVC+CORR might be more accurate than SVC+AQP and vice versa. 

However, if we do know more about the distribution, this optimality is not true in general. The intuitive problem is that if there are a small number of parameters that completely describe the discrete distribution there might be a way to reconstruct the distribution from those parameters rather than estimating the mean. As a simple counter example, if we knew our attributes were exactly on a line, a sample size of two is sufficient to answer any aggregate query. However, even for many parametric distributions, the sample mean estimators are still MVUEs, eg. poisson, bernouilli, binomial, normal, exponential. It is often difficult and unknown in many cases to derive an MVUE other than a sample mean. Furthermore, the sample mean is unbiased for all distribution, but it is often the case that alternative MVUEs are biased when the data is not exactly from correct model family (such as our example of the line). Our approach is valid for any choice of estimator if one exists, even though we do the analysis for sample mean estimators and this is the setting in which that estimator is optimal."

\noindent\textbf{Reviewer 2}

\emph{There are several assumptions and restrictions that are not spelled out clearly in the first part of the paper. It should be clarified how much they limit the applicability of the proposal. The real-world scenarios used is very interesting, but do the techniques apply in other popular applications, where the assumption in sec 4.2 may not hold?}

This review is addressed above in Meta Review Section.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{It is great to see many technical and engineering contributions, but the paper is very dense and hard to read. The first clear example of what is going on appears at page 4, after the reader had tried hard to understand the problem statement in sec 3.3.1. The presentation should be revised, also to avoid the continuos references to the tech report for details.}

We have revised the presentation of the work to be easier to follow. In Section 2.1, we describe a running example of Video Streaming Log Analysis. In Section 3, there are two detailed examples of the concepts presented. Example 1 describes the terminology and pre-requisite concepts in terms of a concrete use case, and Example 2 illustrates the end-to-end workflow of \svc. In Section 4, we added Example 3 to clarify the reviewer concern about the applicability of primary key lineage in this setting and Example 4 to show how we can optimize sampling of a materialized view in a real application. In Section 5, we add Example 5 to describe our query processing approaches. In Section 6, we add Example 6 to describe how outlier indexing would be used in practive. We have further minimized the references to the technical report. The technical report is now only for details in the experimental setup. The theoretical presentation of this work is now self contained.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{There are recent proposals in data cleaning over materialized views that tackle an orthogonal problem: given a view, they clean a sample of its data and go back to the base relations to identify useful explanations. While the setting is different, work has been done on how to use a different statistical measure (sensitivity analysis) to tackle similar technical problems (sec 5.1.1, sec 6.3). Given the data cleaning angle of the proposal, a comparison with these techniques is relevant in this work.}

We address this issue in Meta Review 3.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{I would recommend the authors to revise the presentation of the paper to make it more accessible to the readers, for example with more examples and by limiting the tech report for relevant information. While it is great to show great engineering effort, I think it would be beneficial for this work to deliver more clearly what are the key intuitions and novel ideas. For example, I am not sure I understand the need to conduct the experiment on a distributed platform, as it doesn't touch any of the key contributions of the work. Of course, it is hard to add examples, comparisons, and clarifications without removing something, but in this case I'd say this experiment could be moved to the tech report to leave more room to clarify the basic ideas of the paper and make it more self-contained (e.g., the discussion on CLT with the ref to [36]).}

To make the presentation more accessible, we have revised the work with the clarifying examples described above, and introduced a itemized summary of all of the components in Section 3.2. We have also revised Section 4 (Stale View Cleaning) of the paper with the following clarifications: introducing problem specific challenges (Section 4.1) and a clarified presentation of Provenance (Section 4.2-3). As the reviewer suggested, we have limited the use of the technical report to experimental engineering details. In our submission, many of the details in Section 5 (Query Result Estimation) were omitted and discussed in the technical report. In addition to the clarifying examples described for review B2, we have made the following revisions to Section 5 to make it more accessible: (1) we present itemized algorithms for our query result estimation approaches, (2) we provide SQL descriptions of confidence interval calculations via the CLT, and (3) we present a simpler taxonomy of different families of aggregate queries and their properties. 
\vspace{1em}
\emph{I would anticipate a discussion on the context in which the approach works. I would also like to understand why it is hard to go beyond the assumptions with a more general discussion. Right now there are limitations spread over the paper: }

In the meta review, we discuss the general revisions to clarify our underlying assumptions.

\noindent\emph{- in 3.3.2 for the sql I was also expecting an experiment to see different quality results depending on the selectivity of the query}
We included a theoretical analysis of selectivity in Section 5.3.3. If p is the selectivity of the query, the confidence interval scales as a function of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}$. Therefore, for a fixed accuracy there is a tradeoff between maintenance cost and the selectivity of queries you can answer. Furthermore, since selectivity just acts as a scaling to the confidence interval, the effects of a more selective workload are similar to the effects of a higher data variance workload. Due to this linear scaling, the effects of selectivity are predictable. Due to a space constraint, we include an experiment in our technical report to address this issue.

\noindent\emph{- in 4.2 for the PK requirement  this seems very strong and not realistic in many applications: what if this assumption does not hold? would AQP also fails?}

We have clarified that the primary key definition proposed in 4.2 (Section 4.3 in the revised paper) is not an assumption but a generation procedure. For the relational expressions described in the paper (select, project, join, aggregate, union, difference), if there is a unique primary key for the base relations, we can ensure that any derived relation also has a unique primary key by the rules described in Definition 2. If the base relations do not have primary keys, then we can add an extra column to the relation that assigns each row a unique id. We added Example 2 to describe this process concretely.

\noindent\emph{- in 6.1 for the background knowledge is it realistic to have the user defining all these indexes? can also the traditional incremental solution benefit for a similar optimization? you should clarify if the experiments before 7.2.4 are done with or without the indexing. If they all done without the indexing, it seems that your methods does not really needed this optimization}

We have added clarification on how these indices may be constructed in Section 6.1:
There are many approaches to select a threshold. We can use prior information from the base table, a calculation which can be done in the background during the periodic maintenance cycles. If our size limit is $k$, for a given attribute we can select the top-k records with that attributes. Then, we can use that top-k list to set a threshold for our index.  Then, the attribute value of the lowest record becomes the threshold $t$. Alternatively, we can calculate the variance of the attribute and set the threshold to represent $c$ standard deviations above the mean.
This outlier optimization is only relevant to sampling based approaches as those can be sensitive to the presence of outliers. Traditional IVM cannot benefit from this approach. 
We have also clarified that none of our experiments before 7.2.4 used an outlier index. The caveat is that these experiments were done with a moderately skewed dataset with Zipfian parameter = 2, if this parameter is set to 4 then the 75% quartile query estimation error is nearly 20% (Figure 11). In this setting, outlier indexing significantly helps for both SVC+AQP and SVC+CORR.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{As mentioned in B3, the authors can find related techniques in the recent work on data cleaning over views. It would be useful to have a technical discussion of how the proposed techniques can be applied in this related setting and vice versa (an experimental evaluation is not needed):
- Wu and Madden. Scorpion: Explaining Away Outliers in Aggregate Queries. PVLDB 2013
- Chalamalla et al. Descriptive and prescriptive data cleaning. SIGMOD 2014
- Meliou et al. Tracing data errors with view-conditioned causality. SIGMOD 2011}

This discussion is clarified in the Meta Review section and we have added a discussion to our related work.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{I am not sure I got why you are not reporting the execution times for AQP in fig 7.a, 9.a, 11.a. It would be interesting to have it to understand better the trade-off.}

To address this comment, we clarified the contributions of our approach. In our Stale Sample View Cleaning problem, we study how to efficiently maintain a sample of a materialized view. After maintenance, there are two query result estimation approaches that can be used: SVC+CORR and SVC+AQP. Thus, the “maintenance time” for both SVC+CORR and SVC+AQP is the same as they both use SVC as an underlying sample maintenance framework.  In fig 7.a, 9.a, and 11.a, we measure the maintenance time so there is no need to compare the methods. 

\vspace{1em}
\emph{I got the justification for Def 1 only after reading the rest of the paper (e.g., sec 4.4). While it is natural, the first time I read it I was wondering why don't model it as a graph homomorphism, or any common, existing definition to describe a transformation between two instances. It would be easier to understand and justify.}

We have clarified this point by re-arranging the text. The correspondence definition is now in Section 4.5, where we carefully explain the intuition behind this property. Correspondence formalizes the link between the unique keys in sample of a stale materialized view and a sample of an up-to-date materialized view. From the text:" 
We started with a uniform random sample $\widehat{S}$ of the stale view $S$. The hash push down allows us to efficiently materialize the sample $\widehat{S}'$. $\widehat{S}'$ is a uniform random sample of the up-to-date view S. While both of these samples are uniform random samples of their respective relations, the two samples are correlated since $\widehat{S}'$ is generated by cleaning $\widehat{S}$. In particular, our hashing technique ensures that the primary keys in $\widehat{S}'$ depend on the primary keys in $\widehat{S}$. Statistically, this positively correlates the query result $q(\widehat{S}')$ and $q(\widehat{S})$. We will see how this property can be leveraged to improve query estimation accuracy (Section \ref{re})."
We also clarified the correspondence formally in Property 1, where we define four intuitive conditions: uniformity, removal of superfluous rows, sampling of missing rows, and key preservation for updated rows.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{typos:
(1) sec 1: which USES APPLIES data
(2) sec 3.2: STRATFIED sampling
(3) some sentences need revised punctuation. For example, in sec 6: "The intuition is that there.... outliers"
(4) missing $s$ at the end of 7.1.1
(5) sec 7.2.1: , instead of . after view}

We have corrected these typos.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{Reviewer 3}

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Major flaws in the presentation: Most of the concepts and algorithms are introduced using words (and on top of that formulations that can be misinterpreted), making it hard to completely follow and be able to replicate the proposed approach. Other presentation issues include lack of examples, and introduction of the approach not in a standalone way but through comparison to previous work by the authors.}

We have added the following formalization to clarify the concepts presented in the paper. In Section 3.1, we formalize the prerequisite concepts in this work: materialized view maintenance, staleness data error, unique primary keys, and uniform sampling. We conclude Section 3.1 with a detailed discussion of our running example making the formalization concrete. In Section 3.2, we present an itemized formal workflow of the entire SVC system. This introduces the two problems addressed in this work: Stale Sample View Cleaning and Query Result Estimation. In Section 4, we add Definition 1-3, Proposition 1, and Property 1 to formally present the key concepts in our work. In addition, there are two examples in this section to clarify the concepts. In Section 5, we present itemized descriptions of the algorithms for query result estimation and present the confidence interval calculation in terms of SQL expressions. We have minimized references to our prior work, SampleClean. We introduce this once and describe the key contributions that build on the SampleClean theoretical framework.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Support for non-aggregate queries seems like an afterthought: It is only briefly discussed in two paragraphs in Section 5.3 and it is not clear how it would work (and how the error in such a case could be measured). As far as I could tell no experiments were executed on such queries.}

Due to space restrictions, we have removed our discussion of support for non-aggregate queries as it is not essential to our work. SVC can support error estimation for SELECT queries (with low selectivity) by estimating how many row are missing due to sampling.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Motivation is slightly weak, given that recent IVM approaches, such as DBToaster have suggested that IVM can be greatly accelerated, making it thus much easier to keep up with changes to the base tables.}

In Meta Review 5, we clarify that there are some views for which even DBToaster is slow. Sampling, as proposed in this work, reduces the cost of maintenance and is complementary to the choice of maintenance algorithm.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{The paper's main motivation is that eager IVM cannot keep up with the rate of incoming updates. However, there have been approaches in the literature (most notable DBToaster) suggesting that this issue can be resolved by accelerating IVM. Do you think that there is still a need of SVC? What is the rate of updates over which a system such as DBToaster cannot keep up with the updates?}

We first clarify that SVC is complementary to the choice of maintenance algorithm. Sampling has the potential to reduce maintenance costs for any algorithm (provided it can be specified in relational algebra) by reducing the number tuples processed. In the specific case of DBToaster, over the TPCH queries there was a 3 order of magnitude variation in maintenance throughput with some refresh latencies as high as .1s for even a 100MB database. If this data grows, is distributed, or resources are contended by other tasks, this latency can easily grow significantly. While approaches like DBToaster greatly accelerate IVM, there are some views that are slow to maintain just due to processing each tuple for aggregates and joins. Sampling reduces the number of tuples processed and trades off accuracy in these settings where eager maintenance is expensive.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{What is the exact IVM algorithm that is used in the experiments?}

The algorithm that we used for Incremental View Maintenance is the change-table (called a delta table in our work) algorithm described in “Incremental maintenance of aggregate and outerjoin expressions” by Gupta and Mumick 2006. This is cited and clarified in our experiments section. From the text,
The incremental maintenance algorithm used in our experiments is the ``change-table" technique proposed in \cite{gupta2006incremental}. We implement incremental view maintenance with an ``update...on duplicate key insert'' command. We implement \svc's sampling operator with a linear hash written in C that is evoked in MySQL as a stored procedure. In all of the applications, the updates are kept in memory in a temporary table, and we discount this loading time from our experiments.


\vspace{1em}
\emph{In the join view experiment, you report the accuracy of SVC for 10\% sample size. What is the update size in this case? It would be great to see how the update size (which has been shown before to affect the speedup) affects also the accuracy of the algorithm.}

We clarified that the update size was 1GB corresponding to 10\% of the base data (Figure 5). Figure 6b illustrates the tradeoff between update size and the accuracy of the algorithms. SVC+CORR grows in error proportional to the update rate, while SVC+AQP stays constant. The break even point is when the update size is about 30\% of the base data. 

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Formulations: Most of the concepts are introduced very informally in words, in a way that makes it hard to fully understand what is meant. The use of terminology is very lax as well. }

See Meta Review 1 for the summary of changes made to the concepts.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Here are a few examples: (a) definition 1 is not formal enough. For instance, what does it mean ``required a delete"? Although in this case one can understand what is meant, it should be presented in a more rigorous way,} 

We revised the definition of staleness data error. We included both an intuitive definition and a formal definition for this concept:
\noindent \textbf{Staleness as Data Error: } The consequences of staleness are incorrect, missing, and superfluous rows. 
Formally, for a stale view $S$ with primary key $u$ and an up-to-date view $S'$:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] \sloppy
	\item \textbf{Incorrect: } Incorrect row errors are the set of rows (identified by the primary key) that are updated in $S'$: \[\{\forall u \in S : (\exists u \in S' \wedge (\sigma_u(S) \ne \sigma_u(S')))\}\]
	\item \textbf{Missing: } Missing row errors are the set of rows (identified by the primary key) that exist in the up-to-date view but not in the stale view: \[\{\forall u \in S' : \not \exists u \in S\}\]
	\item \textbf{Superfluous: } Superfluous row errors are the set of rows (identified by the primary key) that exist in the stale view but not in the up-to-date view : \[\{ \forall u \in S : \not\exists u \in S' \}\]
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\emph{The term ``query correction" in Section 3.3.2 is misleading since it is not the query statement that is corrected but the query result}

We have also revised the query correction term to “Query Result Estimation” which we feel is more accurate.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{In the last paragraph in Section 7.1.2, the views are referred to interchangeably as ``views" and ``dataset". I would suggest to have a more formal introduction of the concepts and establish a terminology that is used consistently throughout the paper.}

We corrected the inconsistencies in term usage, using the term “dataset” ONLY to refer to the base data of the experimental data from TPCH and Conviva. 

\vspace{1em}
\emph{If you end up needing more space in the process a few places you could compress are the following: (a) the algebra in Section 3.1, since it is standard relational algebra, (b) Section 7.3.2, which although interesting is I believe less important than a formal representation of the core concepts, (c) Section 7.2.3 (together with the corresponding graphs) which could be replaced just by a datapoint showing that if hashing cannot be pushed down, the resulting speedup is limited.}

We have also incorporated the reviewer’s space saving suggestions by revising the presentation of the relational algebra.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Algorithms: Please try to introduce the algorithms formally (e.g., through pseudocode). Also consider adding a more formal description of the entire workflow followed by SVC apart from Figure 1 (something close to the itemization in Section 5.2 but with formal notation instead).}

We have included an itemization for all of the algorithms in Section 5, including the SQL for calculating the bounds for \sumfunc, \avgfunc, and \countfunc and the pseudocode for the bootstrap algorithm to bound general aggregate queries. In addition, in Section 3.2 we added an itemized description of the full workflow of SVC.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Related Work: Currently comparisons to related work (especially SampleClean but also AQP and SAQP) are dispersed in various places throughout the paper, breaking its flow. In many cases SVC is not introduced on its own but through comparisons to SampleClean (e.g., in Sections 3.3.2, 5.1, 5.2, etc). I would suggest to introduce instead SVC without reference to SampleClean and if a comparison is needed, to limit it either to Section 2 or to a short discussion at the end of each (sub)section.}

We have addressed the reviewers suggestion and made this comparison more concise and introduced SVC on its own. SampleClean is cited once in Section 2.2, where we introduce SVC and explain the challenges in the materialized view problem setting that differ from the problem studied in SampleClean. In the remaining paper, references to SampleClean’s algorithms and approaches have been removed. Section 5 has been greatly revised to present SVC on its own. We present a self contained theoretical discussion of the Central Limit Theorem and how to calculate the confidence intervals. We only cite SampleClean once in Section 5.2 in reference to other approximate query processing techniques that use analytic confidence intervals.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Examples: Please add examples after the introduction of each concept/algorithm to help the reader follow them. For instance, present the correction generated for the running example in Section 5.1. Similarly, show the generated plan in the presence of indexes in Section 6.2.}

We introduced a running example in Section 2.1. This example is used to clarify theory in Section 3.1, 3.5, 4.3, 4.6, 5.1, and 6.4. In Section 6.4, we describe a concrete example of how to use the outlier index to generate a query result estimation plan.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Figures/References: Please increase the size of both figures and references, as they are currently extremely hard to read. In the case of figures you may be able to achieve this simply by using more concise captions.}

With our saved space we have increased the size of images and captions

\emph{Abbreviations: Please make sure that you have introduced all abbreviations before you use them and remind the reader of their meaning if they have been defined in previous sections. For instance, (a) SAQP used in Section 5.2 has not been defined and (b) AQP used in Section 5.1 has just been defined in passing in Section 2.1 and should probably be re-introduced.}

We have taken the reviewers suggestion and clarified these acronyms in Section 2 and Section 5.

\emph{p. 1, col. 1, last par.: ``making incremental maintenance infeasible" -> You probably mean ``making eager incremental maintenance infeasible"}

We have made this revision.

\emph{The primary key of the result of a union, intersection and difference between R\_1 and R\_2 is erroneously defined as the primary key of R. It should instead be expressed in terms of R\_1 and R\_2.}

We have made the following revisions to fix this definition:
(1) $R_1 \cup R_2$: Primary key of the result is the union of the primary keys of $R_1$ and $R_2$, (2) $R_1 \cap R_2$: Primary key of the result is the intersection of the primary keys of $R_1$ and $R_2$, and (3) $R_1 - R_2$: Primary key of the result is the primary key of $R_1$

\emph{Theorem 2: I could not parse the 2nd sentence of the theorem. Please rephrase!}

We added a clarification to Section 5.2.4 to simplify the discussion of optimality. It is now framed as a discussion of conditions under which our technique is optimal rather than an absolute claim of optimality. The practical implications of this result are discussed.

\emph{I could not parse the sentence ``We remove views... or are static". Please rephrase!}

We clarified this statement in the following way:
10 out of the 22 sets of views can benefit from \svc.
For the 12 excluded views, 3 were static (i.e, this means that there are no updates to the view based on the TPCD workload), and the remaining 9 views have a small cardinality not making them suitable for sampling.

- p. 3, col. 1, example: ``then the following expressions are needed"
- p. 3, col. 1, last line: ``Stratified sampling"
- p. 3, col. 2, first par. of Section 3.3.2: ``Given a query q which has been applied to the stale view q(S) giving a stale result, out query"

- p. 8, col. 2, par. 4: ``and use those as our materialized views"
- p. 8, col. 2, par. 5: Change the symbols in the two predicates involving countryCode
- p. 8, col. 2, par. 2: ``For small update sizes, the speedup is smaller, 6.5x for a 2.5\% (250GB) update size": it should probably be "MB" instead of "GB"
- p. 12, col. 1, par. 4: ``if that is a black box"}

We have made this changes to the text.
